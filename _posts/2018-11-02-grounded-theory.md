Interesting references about construction of theories with Grounded Theory method.

"... It is important to understand that in any empirical study, theories have a strong impact on how things are observed and interpreted. The theory becomes a “lens” through which the world is observed. This happens whether or not theories are explicitly acknowledged, because real-world phenomena are simply too rich and complex to study without a huge amount of filtering. In quantitative research methods, the theoretical lens is used explicitly to decide which variables to isolate and measure, and which to ignore or exclude. In qualitative methods, the theoretical lens is often applied after data is collected, to focus the process of labeling and categorizing (“coding”) the data..."
