### What is a theory?
According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, a Theory is "a plausible or scientifically acceptable general principle or body of principles offered to explain phenomena"

### Why is it so important?
"The theory becomes a “lens” through which the world is observed. This happens whether or not theories are explicitly acknowledged, because real-world phenomena are simply too rich and complex"[2]
