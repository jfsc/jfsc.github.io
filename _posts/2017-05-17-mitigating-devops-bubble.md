In order to provide some toughts about DevOps and mitigate the DevOps bubble, I`ve asked to my friend and research advisor [@vinicius3w](https://twitter.com/vinicius3w) if I could present some results of my research by teaching DevOps in one of his disciplines at [UFPE](http://www2.cin.ufpe.br/site/index.php). The presented proposal was about Cloud+DevOps, which has a high level of sinergy from my stading point.

He did like and has opened the doors. Thus, here is the Lessons: 
* [01DevOps-intro](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/01devops.pdf)
* [02DevOps-sdlc](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/02devops.pdf)
* [03DevOps-agile](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/03devops.pdf)
* [04DevOps-pipeline](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/04devops.pdf)

The contribution of my invited colleges Jessica and Marina: 
* [Invited - Testing](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/invitedcolleges.pdf) 

Finally, an interesting project: 
* [IF1006-project](http://jfsc.github.io/static/docs/IF1006-project.pdf)

And, the artifacts:
